# Bacterial Track Analysis

The MATLAB code package for statistical analysis of bacterial trajectories. The tracks were extracted using the novel 3D-tracking method. 

For details on the method see the article ["High-throughput 3D tracking of bacteria on a standard phase contrast microscope"](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9776).
